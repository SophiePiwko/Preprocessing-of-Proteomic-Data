# üìä Preprocessing of Proteomic Data 
After running samples through the mass spectrometer, we align the resulting data against a known database to identify the proteins present in our samples. 
This alignment is typically performed using software called DIA-NN (Data Independent Acquisition Neural Network), 
which generates a matrix listing the peptides identified and quantified in each sample, along with their corresponding intensities.

We usually import this matrix into another program called Perseus for data preprocessing. 
However, Perseus has several significant drawbacks, which motivated me to learn Python and enroll in this course. 
During my master's, I analyzed 37 samples using Perseus, but the software frequently crashed, causing me to lose my work‚Äîan incredibly frustrating experience.

While Perseus has a user-friendly interface, it comes at the cost of limited flexibility. 
Users can only perform tasks that are already built into the software, with little room for customization or advanced options.

Since I will be handling many more samples during my PhD, I decided not to rely on Perseus for analysis. 
Instead, I plan to use Python to process my data, which will provide greater control, flexibility, and reliability. 

So in this project, written in Python 3, I would like to streamline and automate the preprocessing steps to apply on my previous samples as well as my future samples. 

# üí° What does this project do? 
The preprocessing steps include:
1. Cleaning the column names
2. Bar plot with Protein ID for each sample
3. Heatmap to look at the overall missingness of the raw data
4. Log transformation and histograms to see if the data is distributed normally
5. Adding annotations and plotting the top 20 annotations
6. Filtering genes based on a threshold of valid values
7. Imputation based on normal distribution
8. Histogram to visualize the overall distribution and the imputed data
9. PCA plot to see the unsupervised clustering of the data

# ‚û°Ô∏è Input and Output ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
The input is the pg_matrix.tsv file received from DIA-NN and the output is multiple .csv files after each rpocessing step. This includes a .csv file after cleaning the column name, log transforming the data, adding annotations, filtering the data based on a user defined threshold and finally imputing data based on normal distribution. In addition, an .html file will be generated including multiple plots created throughout the processing steps. 

# üëâ Requirements üëà
Download the working_directory folder. This folder includes the raw dataset, a requirements.txt file with the needed packages, a zipped file with the annotations and of course the python code.
